# ContrastMotifDiscovery
As games gain popularity, demands for players' behavior analysis techniques increases. This paper introduces a method for understanding game player's behavior based on event sequences. Our method automatically detects contrasting motifs between groups of sequential data, that is, to discover subsequences that are significantly closer to one set of sequences compared to other sets. Our approach, compared to existing methods, has the advantage of being capable of handling long sequences. We employed our proposed sequence mining approach to analyze players' behavior in Minecraft. Minecraft is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) which enables players to cooperate with other players. We applied our method to study Minecraft actions and collaboration of players in this game. We discovered contrast motifs of player actions in Minecraft. We also extracted and analyzed contrast motifs of players' behavior to compare more collaborative players with less collaborative ones.
